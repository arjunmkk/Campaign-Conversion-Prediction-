# Campaign-Conversion-Prediction-
This project focuses on predicting campaign conversion using Machine Learning techniques.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains historical campaign performance data including:
• Campaign type
• Total leads generated
• Sales achieved
• Conversion rate
• Cost per lead
• Total campaign cost
The target variable is campaign conversion (Converted / Not Converted).
Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were applied:
• Removal of null and duplicate values
• Feature selection based on relevance
• Encoding categorical variables
• Splitting data into training and testing sets
• Feature scaling where required
Machine Learning Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression:
A supervised classification algorithm used to model the probability of conversion.
It is simple, interpretable, and effective for binary classification problems.
Random Forest Classifier:
An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve
prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting
